# Repair Partitioning

Re-Pair is an algorithm traditionally used for text compression. Here, it's used to partition documents into similar fragments. The main application of this is indexing a versioned collection of documents for search. 

## Repair Algorithm and Example
The logic behind Re-Pair is wonderfully simple

* Identify all pairs of symbols in the string (the string [1 2 3 1 2] gives us the pairs (1,2), (2,3), and (3,1))
* Replace the highest occurring pair (in our case (1,2)) with a new symbol (we use the next available number; in our case, 5)
* Store the association 5 -> (1,2)
* Continue until there is one symbol remaining

You can then recreate the original string from the last symbol by recursively expanding it. Here's the full example:

```
[1 2 3 1 2]
5 -> (1,2)

[5 3 5]
6 -> (5,3)

[6 5]
7 -> (6,5)

[7]
```

Applying all the rules gives us a tree:
```
			 7
			/ \
		   6    5
		  / |  | \
		 5	3  1  2
		/ \
	   1   2
```
Read off the leaves (aka terminals) from left to right: [1 2 3 1 2] -> the original string!

## Accounting for Versions

In this implementation, I consider versions of a text document. By running Repair on all these versions, I expect that repeating fragments will get the same symbol. If two versions of a document are similar, then their Repair Trees will be similar as well. This can be used to help build a more efficient text index for versioned systems.

To visualize this, just try doing repair on these two strings, and compare the trees: [1 2 3 1 2 3 1 4], [1 2 1 2 2 3 1 4]. When choosing the most occurring pair, consider occurrences in both versions.

## Paritioning Algorithm

Once you get the Repair Trees, you can cut them in a way that maintains boundaries of common fragments.

TODO: add details here on offsets and the output format.

## Example Usage
```
make

repair help
	Output:
	repair <directory> <fragmentationCoefficient> <minFragSize> <method>
	repair <directory> <fragmentationCoefficient> <minFragSize>
	repair <directory> <fragmentationCoefficient>
	repair <directory>
	repair

repair [args]

```

Included in this repo are some example inputs, so you can run the following:

```
repair ./Input/ints/

repair ./Input/alice/

repair ./Input/alice/ 2.0 10 1 (fragmentationCoefficient = 2.0, minFragSize = 10, and using the greedy algorithm)

repair ./Input/alice/ 1.0 100 0 (fragmentationCoefficient = 2.0, minFragSize = 10, and using the naive algorithm)

repair ./Input/alice/ (use the default values specified in the code)
```
