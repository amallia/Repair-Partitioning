/*

Current Status:

8/27/12 (I think)
[Done] Just changed all the chars to unsigned, and implemented word -> wordID translation
	[Done] We have a vector of wordIDs to work with, it's no longer char based
		[See below] Extracting the pairs and filling the two data strcutures (HT + heap) is buggy

9/7/12
[Done] Refactored and fixed a bunch of problems with extract pairs
[Done] Implemented a consistent understanding of adding occurrences and setting prec/succ
	[Fixed] Still need to clean up the classes based on all of this
		[See below] About to implement all removals, this should address the above

[Fixed] OK so now, we have this huge if else structure for all the cases with the linked list
	[Fixed]	This needs to be refactored (a lot of statements in there are repeated)
	[See below]	Also, there are access violations, so need to think more about what's happening with memory I'm using

9/9/12
[Fixed]	Refactored that huge if else structure, now it's logically related to the edge cases
[See below] The linked list of Occurrences isn't being properly handled, something to do with removal of occurrences...

9/10/12
[Fixed] Removing the hashTable[key] was happening every time (added the appropriate condition)
[Fixed] myHeap.front() is not giving the highest occurring element, so the comparison function is either wrong on not being used
[TempFix] Heap Entries are being sort of deleted, but not fully, so ending up with numOccurrences = 23123129083 or something
	=> Instead of an efficient remove for the heap, ran through the whole thing

9/11/12 (Early)
[Update] No runtime errors
[] Not sure if associations are correct (consider implementing fillTree for this)
[Fixed] not all associations have consecutive IDs, and they should
[Done] The associations now print at the end of the program

9/12/12
[] Introduce separators and concept of versions

9/18/12
[shit] No progress since 9/12, have been working on other projects...

9/20/12
[Fixed] Some bugs (program used to crash on non trivial input)

9/21/12
[Fixed] Linear removal is likely the cause of poor performance


9/24/12
[Done] No progress since last time (learned a bit about stl heaps, might have to write my own)
[Not needed] I did try to use the valid flag approach, with unfortunate results
	[Not needed] Something got corrupted, like the heap (not a heap, the heap).... not sure wtf was wrong

[Great] Checked out Jinru's code for winnowing and discovered the data type for representing fragment boundaries
	[Great] An int* called starts, here's an example [0, 10, 17, 24, 38]
		[Great] In this example, the fragments are (0,9), (10,16), (17,23), (24,37), (38, docSize)

[Done] Have an idea of how to implement deletion of an arbitrary element in the heap
	[Done] It's stored as a vector, and the tree is conceptual
		[Done] So swap with the back(), pop_back(), and reheapify
		[Done] Wait, didn't I try this already, and wasn't the heap invalid? Let's see...


9/26/12
Talked to Sergey, and have a new plan
[Done] Profile: created a profiler, now using it
[Done] Instead of using new and delete, use an object pool
[Done] Implement the damn log(n) remove

[Result] Basically we need to create an object pool and also fix the O(n) remove

9/27/12
[Done] Implementing Object Pool: Results are weak. Gotta fix the algorithm itself (re-examine pooling later)

10/8/12
[I know] Well that was a long break...

10/9/12
[Done] Writing RandomHeap (THAT SHIT WORKS)
[Not 30 minutes...] Integrate into this code (just keep track of positions, not that hard)
	DEBUG THIS FOR LIKE 30 MINUTES AND YOU GOT IT!
		===>LOL, nope

10/12/12
[Done] Still debugging runtime errors
[Done] Now it looks like prec and succ are not properly being removed (they have mem addresses that seem to have been freed, ex: 0xfefefefe)
[Done] The heap seems to work nicely on its own, priorities and indexes look ok
[Fixed] Memory is being corrupted when calling mapExists() More 0xfefefefe type stuff

10/17/12
[Great] After an awesome session with Costas, I'm much closer to solving this
[Done] Latest error: prec and succ aren't being set properly somewhere
[Great] Note: heap seems ok, finally

10/19/12
[Done] The problem is now in the linking to prec and succ, check the code for that in repair, as the link function itself is easy
[IT WORKS BITCHES]

------------------------------------------------------------
What have we learned so far?

1) Think before you implement anything, however simple.
2) Version control, always!
3) Don't worry about wasting time, sometimes proper implementation can take a while.
