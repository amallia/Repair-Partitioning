Dear Google,
I’m a software developer who has worked on a few professional projects during college, and I’m very excited to focus on my career full time. I’ll be graduating from The Polytechnic Institute of New York University in December with a BS/MS in computer engineering and computer science respectively. Here’s a short account of how I got to where I am now. Hopefully it will give you an idea of where I’m capable of going. 
After tutoring CS for three years at the Polytechnic Tutoring Center and doing well on my course projects, I was offered a great internship at a financial research company. About a week later, a professor of mine introduced me to an entrepreneur who needed programmers for a web application which needed to be scalable, fast, and very user friendly. I was strongly advised that this was the time to take a risk (I was 20).
Going to work for the startup was a tough decision, but as I expected, I gained a lot of skill and learned some very important technologies. After a year of work, since we hadn’t launched, I had to make another tough decision. To finish my master’s degree, I had to do a thesis. So, hard as it was to leave the company, I did, shifting my focus to research. I’ve since been working on a thesis in indexing for versioned document collections. As excited as I was to work for the startup, I love doing research. I’ve found that as long as I’m solving hard problems and collaborating with great people, I can’t wait to get to work.
At Google, I would benefit immeasurably from the experience of senior engineers. I’d have opportunities to learn, to reach millions of people, and to get better at my craft every day. I hope I’ve been able to express my excitement for software development, and for Google. I’d love the chance to show you my talent, so that you can show me my potential. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.
