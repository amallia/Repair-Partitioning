undoRepair can be used to expand all of the nodes. 
I guess knownExpansions can store fragID -> fragContent
	how? it's a map<unsigned, vector<unsigned> >, like {4 -> (5,6), 8 -> (9,10), etc. }
	Well there you go, it already does it, and we're probably not worried about assigning fragment IDs for indexing (Jinru's index.cc does that most likely)
